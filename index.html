			<h3>Hi! My name is Melissa and this is my story with Skinny Fiber </h3>
			<p>
					Throughout my life I have struggled with weight. I have always been bigger than the other girls,
				though not necessarily overweight. It has always fluctuated and in 2007 I was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS), an infertility condition that causes weight gain, acne, insulin resisitance, and so much more. My husband and I decided we wanted children, but we were told my chances of having any weren't very high. At this point, they put me on fertility treatments from 2007-2011. The treatments and pregnancies had brought my weight from 190lbs to 280lbs after the birth of my second son. This made my PCOS symptoms go through the roof and I was tired of being overweight. The doctor told me that losing some weight would help and counter act the PCOS. Hearing this, I turned to a certain diet pill. That pill did help me lose weight but landed me in the hopsital to have my gallbladder removed. The doctor blamed this on that particular pill. They told me that I would have to try the old fashioned way to lose weight. After much trial and error with both the doctor and the dietician, I had no success. Some time had passed when I saw an ad from someone selling an all-natural weight loss supplement and had it confirmed with the doctor that I could take it.
			</p>

			<p>
					This led me to Skinny Fiber. A 100% all-natural supplement that I started with the Skinny Fiber
				90 day challenge taking the supplement 1/2 hour before breakfast and dinner. In combination of taking this supplement and eating correctly gave me amazing results. Within one month my cholesterol levels dropped and I started to lose weight. I lost some weight after the second birth and now after taking Skinny Fiber for 5 months along with eating better and exercising, I am down from 250lbs to 216lbs! Having PCOS makes it very difficult to lose weight, so this was huge for me. I continue to take Skinny Fiber and follow my healthy eating and exercising routine. 
			</p>
			<p>
					With the success that I have had in losing weight, I decided to become a representative for the 
				company. I strongly believe this amazing product can help those who want to lose weight but have struggled with other diets or pills. My mission now is to continue to share my story as well as others and strive to help others. Please feel free to take a look around my sit for more information and feel free to contact me with any questions or interest in any of the products.
