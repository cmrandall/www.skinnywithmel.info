				                  "Tonight I was going through some old pictures on my computer and couldn't believe what I found. I don't even remember taking this before picture because if I ever would've seen it, I would've definitely deleted it immediately. The after picture is of me this weekend.
								  Looking at myself, it's just so hard to believe that that was me. I felt so helpless. I was over 300 pounds, had severe sleep apnea, and day-to-day living was a struggle. My mom mentioned the other day to me that she remembers me visiting her and I would be so tired I couldn't get out of my car. I would make her come outside to visit me so I wouldn't have to get out. Most of the time, while in conversation, I would fall asleep. I wasn't really living, I was slowly dying.
								  For the last 20 years, since high school, I've really been ashamed of myself. There were so many instances that I would run into old-school friends in the store, and I would immediately look down hoping and praying they didn't see me. I definitely never looked anyone in the eyes. I isolated myself from everyone, and stayed in my house. My priority was raising my boys, I was not important.
								  My life is so different now. 14 months ago I discovered skinny fiber and low carb eating. I had no idea that it was going to change my life. Not only have a lost 96 pounds, but I found Courtney. The girl I have lost so many years ago that felt so unworthy. This past year, as the pounds have melted away, my true self is emerging. I found my purpose in life, helping other people, which has helped to save my life.
								  Today, I turn 39 years old. It's my first birthday in more than 20 years that I feel truly happy. I am alive, I am finally free from that prison that I put myself in.
								  To those of you that are wondering if skinny fiber is worth it, it is, it's so is. From someone that has done everything and even ended up in the hospital because of a medication a doctor prescribed to me for weight loss, this can save your life. If you decide to do it, I would encourage you to at least give it a minimum of 90 days. What is 90 days? It's only three months, think about the change that you could have in your life in three months. If it worked for me, why not you? "

				                  "Before picture is in February 2014. After picture is in June 2014. Skinny fiber has really helped me. I'm still a work in progress but let me tell you I love skinny fiber. I've lost 37 total inches and 14lbs in a little over 4 months. I sleep better, eat less, have confidence back which in turn I'm finding me again. I can't say enough about this product. Also I'm still breastfeeding which skinny fiber has helped with that as well. I no longer need a supplement called fenugreek my milk supply has increased and it hasn't bothered my 17 month old. Also use to have a headache on a daily basis not any longer with skinny fiber. So what are you waiting on??"

				                  "I did it!! I have tried so many weight loss supplements and diets and never stuck with them, but this time I did and I am so happy that I did. I started Skinny Fiber the first of this year (2014) and I made a commitment to myself that I am going to actually lose the weight and keep it off. So I started eating better and exercising 2-4 times a week. I have lost 25 pounds and 32.5 inches in 90 days!! I am not stopping here though. I have more weight that I want to lose and I know that Skinny Fiber can help me do it!"

				                  "My latest picture update! I LOVE Skinny Fiber!! True confession...when I started, I was skeptical. Dieting did not work. My acid reflux was horrible (medication twice daily), I couldn't sleep well and my energy level was pitiful. Most evenings I would fall asleep in my chair before 9:00, totally exhausted! When I started taking Skinny Fiber I was at my highest weight ever, 202!! It scared me to think where my body was going health wise with a family history that includes diabetes and heart problems. I had to change, but my body wasn't healthy enough to lose any weight. Skinny Fiber cut my sugar cravings, increased my energy level almost immediately and my fat started to melt away. After 90 days, I saw a dramatic change (see the first picture of me side by side). The inches and weight continued to come off. Yesterday, May 30, 2014, I weighed and 40 pounds are GONE!! My acid reflux is also gone and I sleep great, feel the best I've felt in years and believe I certainly look much better. You can decide. "
